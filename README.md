# Random-variables-generation---Statistical-Signal-Processing-laboratory

This repository contains code used for a university laboratory aimed at experiments on generating random variables from more common distributions, by applying different transformations:
  1. Directly through a function
  2. Through the inverse CDF method
  3. By using random samples from certain distributions to vary the variance of a Gaussian, in order to obtain more complex pdfs. 
The code is written entirely in Python 3.
